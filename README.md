What does n-p-m stand for?

## What

- Never Poke Monkeys
- Node Package Manager
- nom, please more

## How

```sh
npm install npm-expansions --save
```

## Contributing

Just submit a pull request adding an expansion to the list! If you think of multiple possibilities, it's best to submit them as separate PRs, as we may like some but not others.

Some other suggestions:

* be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
* be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* be novel. If your expansion starts with "No", "New", "Never" or "Node" the other two words better be pretty great.
* avoid anything that even slightly hints of violating npm's [code of conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct/). These are literally the first words that appear on the website, and our audience is very broad, so it's best to avoid things that can be misconstrued.
