What does n-p-m stand for?

## What This Is

This is the source code for the three-word thingies that randomly appear in the header of the [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) website. Examples include:

- Naughty Push Message
- Nectar of the Programming Masses
- Needless Pachouli Manufacture
- Neil Patrick's Mansion
- Never Program Mad
- Never Push to Master
- Neverending Plethora of Modules
- Newton's Programmatic Measurements
- Newts Parading Majestically
- Nice Poodle, Mister
- Nickel Plated Moose
- Nineties Party Mix
- Null Pointer Missing
- Nymphets Playing Mahjong

## How to Contribute

Add your own expansion to [expansions.txt](expansions.txt), then send us a pull request! **If you think of multiple possibilities, please submit them as separate PRs**, as we may like some but not others.

Some other suggestions:

- Be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
- Be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
- Be novel. If your expansion starts with "No", "New", "Never" or "Node" the other two words better be pretty great.
- Avoid hyphenation, especially "non-". Yes, there are some in there already. Sorry.
- Use actual words. You can't just make up random new words. Unless they're really good.
- Avoid names of people and products (other than npm ;-))
- Avoid expansions that are gendered, sexual, aggressive, or violent. We are a diverse, positive place.
- Avoid anything that even slightly hints of violating npm's [code of conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct/). These are literally the first words that appear on the website, and our audience is very broad, so it's best to avoid things that can be misconstrued.
