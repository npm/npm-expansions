What does n-p-m stand for?

## What This Is

This is the source code for the three-word thingies that randomly appear in the header of the [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) website. Examples include:

- Naughty Push Message
- Nectar of the Programming Masses
- Needless Patchouli Manufacture
- Neil Patrick's Mansion
- Never Program Mad
- Never Push to Master
- Neverending Plethora of Modules
- Newton's Programmatic Measurements
- Newts Parading Majestically
- Nice Poodle, Mister
- Nickel Plated Moose
- Nineties Party Mix
- Null Pointer Missing

## How to Contribute

1. Add your own expansion to [expansions.txt](expansions.txt)
2. Run `npm test` (this will format and alphabetize the file)
3. Send us a pull request!

**If you think of multiple possibilities, please submit them as separate PRs**, as we may like some but not others.

Some other suggestions:

* Be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
* Be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* Be novel. If your expansion starts with "Node" the other two words better be pretty great.
* Avoid hyphenation, especially "non-". Yes, there are some in there already. Sorry.
* Use actual words. You can't just make up random new words. Unless they're really good.
* Avoid names of people and products (other than npm ;-))
* Avoid expansions that are gendered, sexual, religious, aggressive, or violent. We are a diverse, positive place.
* Avoid anything that even slightly hints of violating npm's [code of conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct/). These are literally the first words that appear on the website, and our audience is very broad, so it's best to avoid things that can be misconstrued.
* Avoid using proper country and/or corporate names

## No More Please

We'll no longer be accepting expansions that begin with the following frequent suggestions:
* National
* Nautical
* Naughty
* Nerd(s)
* Never
* New
* Newly
* Nice
* Nicely
* Nifty
* Ninja(s)
* No
* Non
* Nobody

* Now

## Conflicts

If your Pull Request has conflicts it will be closed automatically. We apologize beforehand for anyone that might have to reopen their contribution after rebasing and/or fixing the issue on their branch. We're looking to [modernize/automate](https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions/tree/feature/automation-refactor) much of the checking/verfication of submissions going forward.
