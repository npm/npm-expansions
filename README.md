# npm-expansions

What does n-p-m stand for?

## What This Is

This is the source code for the three-word thingies that randomly appear in the header of the [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) website. Examples include:

- Nickel Plated Moose
- Nicely Presented Misnomer
- Never Poke Monkeys
- Node Package Manager
- nom, please more

## How to Contribute

Add your own expansion to [index.txt](index.txt), then send us a pull request! If you think of multiple possibilities, it's best to submit them as separate PRs, as we may like some but not others.

Some other suggestions:

* be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
* be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* be novel. If your expansion starts with "No", "New", "Never" or "Node" the other two words better be pretty great.
* avoid hyphenation, especially "non-". Yes, there are some in there already. Sorry.
* use actual words. You can't just make up random new words. Unless they're really good.
* Avoid names of people and products (other than npm ;-))
* avoid anything that even slightly hints of violating npm's [code of conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct/). These are literally the first words that appear on the website, and our audience is very broad, so it's best to avoid things that can be misconstrued.
